  <h1> Devbootcamp: The Experience</h1>

      The DevBootCamp experience is highly intense yet self aware. It is intense due the sheer amount of knowledge that one absorbs in the span of a few months. However, there is a differentiating and compelling focus on self awareness and clarity of purpose that lends itself to an enlightened learning experience.

      I am very excited about engaging in the type of culture that DevBootCamp promotes. As a former Googler I am very well accustomed, even a fan of this culture. It's inspiring to see DevBootCamp take a strong stance on productivity AND culture, when mainstream workplaces seem to only care about productivity, not realizing how interconnected they are.

      I'm not nervous. Just really looking forward to gaining an incredibly exciting new perspective on the world.
