      What are the benefits of version control?

      Version control is exactly what is sounds like. It allows many versions of any particular document to be modified at any given time. This is a great benefit for teams of developers because everybody on the team is able to work on any file at any time and later merge all the changes into a common version.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?

      Git is a system that saves all of your files in your project. It allows you to "commit" your projects at any given time. It then allows for recall of not just the latest version, but the the exact contents of each version that was committed.

      Why use GitHub to store your code?

      Github is the online hub for version control, built on top of Git. While it is known as the largest host of code, it essentially allows for easy hosting of any file. It also allows for easy collaboration on code, via version control.
